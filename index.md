# You don't need to edit this file, it's empty on purpose.
# Edit theme's home layout instead if you wanna make some changes
# See: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults

## HOWEVER, github-pages is currently [2016.10.19] dependent on old
## version of 'minima' theme, version 1.2, which does not have a 'home'
## layout.  Version 2.0 does have a 'home' layout.
# layout: home
layout: default
# title: Override with new title
