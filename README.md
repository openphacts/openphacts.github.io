The purpose of this GitHub Pages website is to provide a place to document the software projects
that make up the Open PHACTS platform.

This GitHub project ("openphacts.github.io") contains the source files for this website.

To update the content of this website, push updated versions of files to the **master** branch
of this GitHub project.  github.com will then automatically update the website content served
from http://openphacts.github.io/.

Alternatively, files can be edited from the github.com site by navigating to the source file in
GitHub and clicking the "pencil" icon located on the right side of the browser window above the
text of the page.

Website source files can either by authored in HTML or Markdown.  GitHub uses the
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) website rendering engine to transform Markdown files into
HTML. For Markdown files to be converted, the *.md file must contain a chunk of Jekyll "Front
Matter" at the beginning of the file.  For examples, look at *.md files in this project.  A
Markdown file contains "Front Matter" if there are two lines consisting of three dashes ("---")
at the top of the file.  Any Markdown file containing "Front Matter" will be converted into an
HTML webpage.
