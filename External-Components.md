> It is an application that handles incoming requests by reading rdf/turtle configuration files (in /api-config-files/) and converting those requests into SPARQL queries which are used to retrieve RDF data from SPARQL endpoints declared in the configuration files.

> The RDF data is then served up in a number of format options, including turtle, rdf/xml and "simple" json and xml formats.

> To use, save your configuration files as turtle with a .ttl extension in "api-config-files/"

Uses Moriarity to make requests to SPARQL endpoints. And cache the responses it gets.
